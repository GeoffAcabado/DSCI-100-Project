    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "Video games have become a widespread form of entertainment, attracting millions of players across diverse demographics [1]. Minecraft stands out as one of the most popular sandbox games, offering an open-ended world where players can build, explore, and interact [2]. In addition to being a popular game, Minecraft provides a rich source of behavioral data that can be leveraged for research in areas such as player engagement, user behavior analysis, and targeted marketing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyze gameplay data collected from a Minecraft research server hosted by a research group at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The group collected detailed logs of player behavior as participants interact with the game world. This data includes various features such as age, playtime, and whether or not a player has subscribed to a newsletter related to the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying data science techniques to this data, we aim to explore whether certain player characteristics, specifically, age and amount of playtime, can be used to predict whether a player subscribes to the game-related newsletter. These two variables were chosen to be the explanatory variables that will train the classification model because they are the only numeric variables in the datasets provided. The insights from this analysis can assist the research team in better understanding the factors that drive player engagement and inform future recruitment and resource allocation strategies. **Table 1.1** shows each of the variables in the player.csv dataset and what do they mean.

All of the supposedly 'negatively infinite' values remained at the bottom of the graph. From Figure 1.2, it can be easily observed that there is no obvious pattern between hours played by the player and their age. Both variables also do not seem to be correlated with whether the players are subscribed or not. However, it is important to notice that everyone who played for 10 hours or more is subscribed to a game newspaper. Another observation we see is that most players are around 15 to 25 years old, indicating that Minecraft is popular among this demographic"

Therefore, these warnings did not affect the final analysis.We then specified a k-NN model using the tidymodels framework **(Code 2.5)**. The number of neighbors (k) was treated as a tuning parameter to be optimized. We defined a grid search over K values ranging from 1 to 25 and fit the model using cross-validation resamples **(Code 2.6)**.

This plot enabled us to visually assess which K values yielded the highest accuracy, helping the selection for the optimal neighborhood size for the final model. We see that there is a local maximum at K = 5 to 8 (excluding k = 6), which is probably the best K for this data set. We see that after K = 10, the accuracy increases again but that is probably just because there are a lot more people subscribed than not subscribed to newspaper. As K increases, the algorithm will just classify any point as \"TRUE\" which results in high accuracy but is not very useful in this context. For such a reason, a value of k = 7 was chosen for the model. Finally, after selecting the optimal K value, the final model will be fit on the full training set and evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall assessing its practical utility in real-world "

    "### IV. Discussion\n",
    "In this study, we developed a classification model to predict whether a player is subscribed to a gaming newspaper based on their age and hours played. After tuning the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm using five-fold cross-validation, we identified that a k value of 7 provided the highest classification accuracy. When evaluated on the testing set, the final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 63.3%, with a precision of 35.0% and a recall of 43.8%. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the model demonstrated some ability to correctly classify subscription status, its moderate precision and recall indicate that its predictions are still limited. The accuracy slightly exceeds what would be expected by random guessing, suggesting that age and hours played contain some information relevant to subscription behavior. However, these two variables alone may not fully capture the complexity of a player's decision to subscribe. Many other unobserved factors such as personal interests, income, social influences, or engagement with game-related content may play a substantial role but are not included in the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of k-NN for this analysis was appropriate because the problem involved classifying observations into one of two categories based on continuous numeric predictors. k-NN makes minimal assumptions about the underlying data distribution, which is advantageous in cases where the true relationship between predictors and outcome may not be easily modeled parametrically. However, k-NN does have certain limitations: its performance can degrade with highly imbalanced classes or irrelevant predictors, and it is sensitive to the scaling of variables hence the need for preprocessing. Moreover, the method does not automatically provide insight into feature importance or underlying causal relationships. Cross-validation was essential to mitigate the risk of overfitting and ensure that the selected model generalized well to new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The findings align partly with expectations: we anticipated that there may be some relationship between game engagement (hours played) and subscription behavior, but that predicting subscription status would likely be challenging with only these two predictors. The moderate performance metrics confirm this intuition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential impact of these findings suggests that while basic gameplay metrics like hours played and age can provide some predictive power, additional variables would be necessary to build a more robust subscription prediction model. This type of model could be useful for gaming companies or publishers interested in identifying which players might be receptive to subscription offers or targeted promotions. \n",
    "\n",
    "These results lead to several future questions. What additional variables might significantly improve predictive performance? Including features such as in-game purchase behavior, player retention, or social activity could strengthen the model. Furthermore, exploring other modeling approaches such as logistic regression or ensemble methods may yield better performance or offer more interpretable insights into the drivers of subscription behavior. Finally, future work could also investigate the temporal dimension, how changes in player behavior over time influence the likelihood of subscription.\n"
