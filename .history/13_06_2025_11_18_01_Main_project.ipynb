    "We see that accuracy is only 63.33% which is only a little bit better than random chance. We also see that precision is 35% and recall is 43.75% which are both bad. These values suggest that the model does not perform reliably, especially when it comes to correctly identifying positive cases. The low precision means that many of the predicted positives were actually incorrect, while the low recall shows that the model missed a large portion of the actual positive cases. One possible reason for this could be an imbalance in the data, where one class is much more common than the other. To improve the model, further testing with different settings and better preparation of the data may be helpful. Exploring other classification methods in the future may also lead to better performance.\n"
