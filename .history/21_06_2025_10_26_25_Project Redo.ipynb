    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "Video games have become a widespread form of entertainment, attracting millions of players across diverse demographics (Atske & Atske, 2024). Minecraft stands out as one of the most popular sandbox games, offering an open-ended world where players can build, explore, and interact (Cipollone, Schifter, & Moffat, 2014). In addition to being a popular game, Minecraft provides a rich source of behavioral data that can be leveraged for research in areas such as player engagement, user behavior analysis, and targeted marketing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyze gameplay data collected from a Minecraft research server hosted by a research group at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The group collected detailed logs of player behavior as participants interact with the game world. This data includes various features such as age, playtime, etc., and whether or not a player has subscribed to a newsletter related to the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying data science techniques to this data, we aim to explore whether certain player characteristics can be used to predict whether a player subscribes to the game-related newsletter. The insights from this analysis can assist the research team in better understanding the factors that drive player engagement and inform future recruitment and resource allocation strategies. **Table 1.1** shows each of the variables in the player.csv dataset and what do they mean.

All of the supposedly 'negatively infinite' values remained at the bottom of the graph. From Figure 1.2, it can be easily observed that there is no obvious pattern between hours played by the player and their age. Both variables also do not seem to be correlated with whether the players are subscribed or not. However, it is important to notice that everyone who played for 10 hours or more is subscribed to a game newspaper. Another observation we see is that most players are around 15 to 25 years old, indicating that Minecraft is popular among this demographic"
